## 🧠 What is Idea Hatch?

**Idea Hatch** is my personal playground for trying out new things in programming.  
This repository contains:
- Random experiments
- Mini projects
- Concepts I'm exploring
- Things that represent *me*

It's not meant for production or public use — just raw, personal learning and growth.

Tools and technologies I may use here:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Python, Java, or other languages I explore
- Git & GitHub

## 🎯 Goals

- Document what I learn
- Stay consistent
- Create things that reflect my personality and growth
